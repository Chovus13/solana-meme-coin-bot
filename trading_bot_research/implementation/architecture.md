# Modular Architecture for a Solana Trading Bot

## 1. Introduction

A modular architecture is essential for building a robust and maintainable trading bot. This design allows for individual components to be developed, tested, and updated independently. For this project, a modular approach will enable the easy integration of new APIs and the ability to enable or disable social media monitoring platforms as needed.

## 2. Core Components

The trading bot can be broken down into the following core components:

- **Data Acquisition**: This module is responsible for fetching data from all external APIs, including Twitter, GMGN, PumpFun, Solsniffer, Reddit, Discord, Telegram, and TikTok.
- **Data Processing**: This module processes the raw data from the acquisition module, cleaning, filtering, and enriching it for further analysis.
- **Signal Generation**: This module analyzes the processed data to identify potential trading signals. This could involve sentiment analysis, trend detection, or other predictive models.
- **Trade Execution**: This module is responsible for executing trades on the Solana blockchain based on the signals generated by the signal generation module.
- **Portfolio Management**: This module tracks the bot's portfolio, including open positions, P&L, and overall performance.
- **Configuration Management**: This module manages all API keys, settings, and other configuration parameters.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: This module provides logging and monitoring capabilities to track the bot's performance and identify any issues.

## 3. Modular Design

Each core component should be implemented as a separate module with a well-defined interface. This will allow for easy integration and the ability to swap out implementations as needed. For example, the data acquisition module could have a separate sub-module for each API, each with a common interface for fetching data.

### 3.1. Social Media Monitoring Modules

The social media monitoring platforms should be implemented as optional modules that can be enabled or disabled through the configuration. This can be achieved using a plugin-based architecture, where each platform is implemented as a separate plugin that can be loaded at runtime.

## 4. Communication between Modules

Modules can communicate with each other using a message queue, such as RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ. This will allow for asynchronous communication and a more decoupled architecture.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Key Libraries**:
    - `requests` for making HTTP requests to APIs
    - `websockets` for real-time data streaming
    - `solana` for interacting with the Solana blockchain
    - `pandas` for data analysis
    - `SQLAlchemy` for database interaction
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ
