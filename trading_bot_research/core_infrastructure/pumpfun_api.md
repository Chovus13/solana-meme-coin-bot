# Pump.fun API for Token Searching

## 1. Introduction

The Pump.fun API provides a set of tools for interacting with the Pump.fun platform. It allows you to get information about tokens, trade tokens, and even create new tokens. For the purpose of this research, we will focus on the token information endpoint, which can be used for searching and discovering new tokens.

## 2. Key Features

- **Free to use**: The API is free to use, but requires an API key.
- **Token Information**: Get detailed information about a specific token.
- **Token Creation**: Create new tokens on the Pump.fun platform.
- **Trading**: Trade tokens on the Pump.fun platform.

## 3. Authentication

All endpoints on the Pump.fun API are protected by a free API key. You can generate an API key from the official documentation website.

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1. Token Information Endpoint

- **URL**: `https://api-pump.fun/api/token_info` (This is a guess, the exact URL needs to be verified from the API Reference section of the documentation)
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves information about a specific token.

## 5. Python Implementation

The following Python code provides an example of how to use the Pump.fun API to get information about a token.

```python
import requests

# Replace with your API key
api_key = "YOUR_PUMPFUN_API_KEY"

# Replace with the mint address of the token you want to query
token_mint_address = "TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS"

# This URL is a guess and needs to be verified
url = f"https://api-pump.fun/api/token_info?mint_address={token_mint_address}"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    token_info = response.json()
    print(token_info)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

## 6. Best Practices

- **Secure your API key**: Treat your API key like a password and do not expose it in your code.
- **Refer to the official documentation**: The Pump.fun API is under active development. Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.
