# Research Plan: Solana Memecoin Trading Bot API Integration (Expanded)

## Objectives
- To provide a comprehensive research report on core APIs and libraries for integrating into a Solana-based memecoin trading bot.
- To detail API specifications, authentication, rate limits, and implementation examples for each service.
- To provide guidance on a modular architecture for enabling/disabling different social media monitoring components.

## Research Breakdown
### Core Trading Infrastructure
- **Twitter API v2**: Research methods for discovering memecoin tickers and analyzing sentiment.
- **GMGN API**: Investigate endpoints for retrieving Solana token data.
- **PumpFun API**: Explore token searching and data retrieval capabilities.
- **Solsniffer.com API**: Analyze the API for assessing token safety and smart contract auditing.
- **Solana Blockchain Interaction**: Research Python libraries and best practices for on-chain interactions.

### Expanded Social Media Monitoring
- **Reddit API (PRAW)**: Research subreddit monitoring, post analysis, and sentiment analysis.
- **Discord API**: Investigate server and channel monitoring for alpha calls.
- **Telegram API**: Explore channel and group monitoring for token mentions.
- **TikTok API**: Research viral content detection and trend analysis.

### Implementation Requirements
- **Authentication**: Document authentication methods for each API.
- **Rate Limiting**: Detail rate limits and best practices for management.
- **Real-time Data**: Investigate streaming capabilities for each service.
- **Error Handling**: Document common errors and fallback mechanisms.
- **Modular Design**: Propose an architecture for a modular system.
- **Data Storage**: Research caching and data storage strategies.
- **Python Examples**: Provide code snippets for each integration.
- **Configuration**: Suggest a configuration management approach.

### Special Considerations
- **Legal Compliance**: Review terms of service for each platform.
- **Alternative Methods**: Research web scraping as a fallback.
- **Cost Analysis**: Analyze costs of paid API tiers.
- **Performance Optimization**: Investigate methods for handling multiple data streams.
- **Security**: Document best practices for API key management.

## Key Questions
1. What are the specific endpoints for each API?
2. What are the authentication requirements for each API?
3. What are the rate limits and how can they be handled?
4. What are the best Python libraries for each integration?
5. How can real-time data be streamed from each platform?
6. What are the best practices for a modular design?
7. What are the legal and ethical considerations for each platform?
8. Are there any unofficial or private APIs that can be used?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: Official API documentation, developer portals, and GitHub repositories.
- **Search strategies**: Targeted search queries for each API and platform.

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: At least two independent sources for critical information.
- **Cross-validation**: Compare information from different sources.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive research report in Markdown format.
- A collection of Python code examples.
- Architectural recommendations for a modular implementation.
- Configuration templates and setup guides.
- Best practices and security considerations.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search-Focused Workflow
- **Justification**: The task requires gathering a large amount of information from various web sources. A search-focused workflow is the most efficient way to collect this data before synthesizing it into the final report.
